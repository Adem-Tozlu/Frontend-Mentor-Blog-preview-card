## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In the course of this project, I have improved my skills in Flexbox. I have learned to use it effectively and have expanded my technical abilities. I have also learned to utilize hover and change colors more effectively. Additionally, I have learned to give and receive feedback, which has been very valuable for my personal and professional development

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to further enhance my CSS skills, particularly in relation to Flexbox and Grid. My goal is to create more complex websites and improve their design. Furthermore, I also aim to work on my animation skills and continue to develop in this area. I am currently in the process of learning Javascript as well!
